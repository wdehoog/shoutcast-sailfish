## shoutcast-sailfish

A Shoutcast player for SailfishOS.

Note that it is still fresh and under development so things might not work as expected. There are no binary builds.

### Features
  * Browse by Genre
  * Search by 'Now Playing' or Keywords
  * Tune in on a Station 

### Issues
  * Accessing the Shoutcast API requires a Dev Key. I requested one but got no reply. Searching the internet shows this happens all the time. So using this app requires a Dev Key and you will have to get or find one. Add it to qml/shoutcast.js.

### Development
This project is developed with the Sailfish OS IDE (QT Creator). 

#### Translations
Translation is done using Qt Quick Internationalisation. If you want to contribute a translation take donnie.ts and create a version for your locale.
